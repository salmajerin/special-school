        <h3>Principal's Message</h3>
	  <p>Dear kindergarten Parents,</br></br>
I am honoured and feel very privileged to be the Principal of Lavender International School, Chittagong.
On behalf of the entire team of L.I.S. , I welcome you to the wonderful experience of learning at Lavender International School. You will be surprised at the amount of learning that will take place in our school.
We are excited about our strong kindergarten team. We have a great combination of talented teachers with qualities that compliment and bring out the best in each other. We enjoy working together, sharing ideas and helping students become Readers, Learners and All-rounder for life. 
Success, one child at a time- the effort to meet each child’s needs for growth ethically, behaviorally, emotionally and academically- is ongoing and intentional. We always use Creative work, Gross Motor Skill, Fine Motor Skill, Formative and Summative Assessments to gather data on the academic growth of our students and use that data to develop appropriate classroom and individualized instruction. We follow “Regular Review and Revision” process for the development of our students. Our teachers “know” their students, identifying strengths, challenges and passions while striving for a positive school experience and love of learning.
We cordially invite you to become an active participants in our school events by joining our P.T.A or attending and supporting our school activities. We believe in building a strong home school relationship which will provide the best for the children of L.I.S.
Finally we look forward to working together as a team and having a successful year in L.I.S.</br></br>
Sincerely yours</br>
Zahira Chowdhury</br>
Principal
